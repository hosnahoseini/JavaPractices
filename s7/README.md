there are 3 version first one(s7-each_note_is_a_file) is the correct one, and the other two is just to test and practice working with files
1. s7-each_note_is_a_file --> each note is in a seprate file
2. s7-notes_as_single_objects_written_in_a_file --> each note is an object written in a same file
3. s7-notes_in_array_written_in_a_file --> notes are member of an array and then the whole array read or write in a file
